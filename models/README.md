# Merging Split ZIP Files

To combine split ZIP files into the original file, follow these steps:

## Windows:
- Right-click on the first part (e.g., `ModelAccuracy85.2%vgg16.zip`).
- Choose `Extract here` with WinRAR or 7-Zip.
- The software will auto-detect all parts and start merging.

## macOS/Linux:
- Ensure all parts are in one folder.
- Open Terminal, navigate to the folder (`cd path/to/folder`).
- Run `unzip ModelAccuracy85.2%vgg16.zip`.
- `unzip` will merge and extract the content.

**Note:** Make sure all parts are present and not corrupted. Always start with the first part.
